<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My first project created after learning the basics of Python and the principles of object-oriented programming.
It was an exam confirming my competence

The point of the task was to create a console-version of the game Sea Battle, with the possibility to play together.
But I decided to go further and make this task more interesting by adding a slightly more beautiful design, 
single player mode and the ability to choose the size of the playing field.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It won't take much to launch
The work was tested on Python 3.10 and higher, but it should work on earlier versions as well.
You will also need to install the colorama package via pip.
In the end, you may just run code in any IDE
